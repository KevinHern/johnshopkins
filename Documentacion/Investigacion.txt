→ PoE
	* Power over Ethernet
	* Technology that lets network cables carry electrical power.
	* Devices with PoE, only need 1 cable, which is the network cable and provides power
	* Advantages:
		- Time and cost savings: by reducing the time and expense of having electrical power cabling installed.  Network cables do not require a qualified electrician to fit them, and can be located anywhere.
		- Flexibility: Devices can be located anywhere without the need of an electrical outlet
		- Safety: Designed to protect network equipment from overload, underpowering, or incorrect installation.
		- Reliability - POE power comes from a central and universally compatible source, rather than a collection of distributed wall adapters
		- Scalability - having power available on the network means that installation and distribution of network connections is simple and effective
	* Applications:
		- VoIP phones
		- Surveillance Cameras
		- Access Points
